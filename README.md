# Social-Network-Mining
Project Overview: Social Network Mining and Analysis

website link:https://social-network-mining.netlify.app/

Objective:

To create an interactive web-based platform that demonstrates the fundamental concepts of social network analysis, community detection, and sentiment analysis in online social networks. The project aims to visualize social structures, detect communities, and analyze user sentiments, providing an engaging learning and exploratory experience.

Features and Functionalities:

1. Network Visualization:

Visual representation of social networks using nodes (individuals/entities) and edges (relationships).

Provides insights into the structure of the network and connectivity between nodes.

Interactive features to explore the graph.


2. Community Detection:

Identification of clusters or communities within the network.

Separate visualization of detected communities for better understanding.

Predefined data for demonstration with scalability for custom inputs.


3. Sentiment Analysis:

Analyze textual data (e.g., tweets, posts, or comments) to extract sentiments such as positive, negative, or neutral.

Simple sentiment analysis logic with potential for integration with advanced machine learning models or APIs.

Input and output interface for user interaction.

Technology Stack:

HTML: Structure of the web application.

CSS: Styling for a visually appealing and responsive design.

JavaScript: Core functionality, including data processing, network visualization, and sentiment analysis.

Vis.js Library: For interactive network and community visualization.

User Flow:

1. Network Visualization Section:

Users view the predefined network and explore relationships between nodes.



2. Community Detection Section:

Users observe how nodes are grouped into communities and analyze inter-community relationships.



3. Sentiment Analysis Section:

Users input text to identify the underlying sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

Use Case Scenarios:

Academic Demonstrations: Helps students and researchers understand social network mining concepts.

Data Exploration: Analyzing relationships and sentiments within online communities.

Business Applications: Understanding user behavior, feedback, and clustering patterns in customer networks.


This project not only showcases key aspects of social network mining but also provides a scalable foundation for advanced analytics and user-driven exploration.
